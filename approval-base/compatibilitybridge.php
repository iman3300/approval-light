// IMPORTANT: This is a temporary compatibility bridge to enable a smooth migration from iTop 2.6- to iTop 2.7+.
// In the next version of the extension, this will be remove and the require_once from the 2.7 will be moved to the 'datamodel' section of the module.itop-portal-url-brick.php file.

// If the portal is installed, then it may use the approval brick
// Important: The approval brick files are required manually and not autoloaded because it would not work as they are in the same namespace than the standard bricks but not in the same directory.
// We wanted to keep the same namespace to simplify future refactoring of this brick with the standard ones.
